#' Weather data from Macleish Field Stations
#'
#' @description Weather data collected at the Macleish Field Station in Whately, 
#' MA during 2015.  This is a copy of the whately_2015 data from 
#' package `macleish`: <https://github.com/beanumber/macleish>.
#'
#' @details The Macleish Field Station is a remote outpost owned by Smith
#' College and used for field research. There are two weather stations on the 
#' premises. One is called `WhatelyMet` and the other is `OrchardMet`.
#' 
#' The `WhatelyMet` station is located at (42.448470, -72.680553) and
#' the `OrchardMet` station is at (42.449653, -72.680315).
#' 
#' `WhatelyMet` is located at the end of Poplar Hill Road in Whately, 
#' Massachusetts, USA. The meteorological instruments of `WhatelyMet` (except the 
#' rain gauge) are mounted at the top of a tower 25.3 m tall, well above the 
#' surrounding forest canopy. The tower is located on a local ridge at an 
#' elevation 250.75m above sea level.
#' 
#' `OrchardMet` is located about 250 m north of the first tower in an open 
#' field next to an apple orchard. Full canopy trees (~20 m tall) are within 
#' 30 m of this station. This station has a standard instrument configuration 
#' with temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and barometric 
#' pressure measured between 1.5 and 2.0 m above the ground. Wind speed and 
#' direction are measured on a 10 m tall tower and precipitation is measured 
#' on the ground. Ground temperature is measured at 15 and 30 cm below the 
#' ground surface 2 m south of the tower. The tower is located 258.1 m above 
#' sea level. Data collection at OrchardMet began on June 27th, 2014. 
#' 
#' The variables shown above are weather data collected at `WhatelyMet` and 
#' `OrchardMet` during 2015. Solar radiation is measured in two different ways: 
#' see `SlrW_Avg`or the `PAR` variables for Photosynthetic Active Radiation.
#' 
#' Note that a loose wire resulted in erroneous temperature reading at OrchardMet
#' in late November, 2015. 
#' 
#' @docType data
#' @format For both, a data frame ([dplyr::tbl_df()]) with roughly 52,560 rows and 8 or 9 variables.
#' 
#' The following variables are values that are found in either the `whately_2015`
#' or `orchard_2015` data tables.
#' 
#' All variables are averaged over the 10 minute interval unless otherwise noted.
#' \describe{
#'   \item{when}{Timestamp for each measurement set in Eastern Standard Time.}
#'   \item{temperature}{average temperature, in Celsius}
#'   \item{wind_speed}{Wind speed, in meters per second}
#'   \item{wind_dir}{Wind direction, in degrees}
#'   \item{rel_humidity}{How much water there is in the air, in millimeters}
#'   \item{pressure}{Atmospheric pressure, in millibars}
#'   \item{rainfall}{Total rainfall, in millimeters}
#'   \item{solar_radiation}{Amount of radiation coming from the sun, in Watts/meters^2. Solar measurement for Whately}
#'   \item{par_density}{Photosynthetically Active Radiation (sunlight between 400 and 700 nm), in average density of Watts/meters^2. One of two solar measurements for Orchard}
#'   \item{par_total}{Photosynthetically Active Radiation (sunlight between 400 and 700 nm), in average total over measurement period of Watts/meters^2. One of two solar measurements for Orchard}
